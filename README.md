## About ##

Here are some python notes and programs made by me during my studies:
- In game_guessing_gallows you can choose between a guessing number game (1) and a gallows game (2);

```shell
# To execute the game
$ python game.py
```

- In harvard_course_cs50 there are some programs made during the [python class](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/weeks/6/);
- In learning_django there are some programs made during the [django class](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/3/);
```shell
# creating a project
$ django-admin startproject project_name

# going to the project folder
$ cd project_name

# creating an application
$ python manage.py startapp app_name

# in settings.py add you 'app_name' in "INSTALLED_APPS"
# in settings.py add you 'app_name' in urlpatterns
# make the configurations

# running the server
$ python manage.py runserver

# migrate data into the database / allow us to create all the default tables inside the django's data base
$ python manage.py migrate

```
- In learning_flask there are some programs using flask;
- In learning_pandas there are some programs using pandas.
